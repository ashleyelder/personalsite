What do you do when there is something that seems not quite right?

It can be a predicament. I was reminded while admiring this tropical plant featured in someone's yard. Months ago this very same type of plant mesmerized me at the store and so I took it home. Over time I couldn't help but notice that it can tolerate poor conditions yet it still looks good as new.

I read more about the plant and found that it's an invasive species that strangles host trees. It uses and kills them.

I detected signs in this plant of doing things to survive that my other plants weren't doing. But I wanted to think but it's a cute plant, but I can leave an impression on its leaf that will last forever, but would my favorite plant store really sell an invasive species?

But after doing this research the fact is undeniable; it is a weed. Reason has prevailed and there's no denying what it truly is, trouble masquerading as something beneficial.

What I'm getting at, telling myself here, is that if something seems off to you, educating yourself helps confirm what maybe you didn't want to know. While an aggresive plant won't necessarily take over your entire yard it may be tougher to handle and care for, and there are usually better options out there. I didn't desire this outcome but learning more is now going to save me some headaches.
